A fun project where I built an automated system for my photo hobby to display a new dog photo every day. Perfect for dog lovers who want to start their day with some furry inspiration!

## Features
- **Daily Dog Updates**: Displays a new dog photo from the collection every day.
- **Automated Uploads**: Uses AWS Lambda to manage the photo rotation.
- **Static Website**: Hosted on AWS S3 with a simple HTML interface.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The design adapts to any screen size.

## How It Works
1. **Photo Collection**: A set of pre-uploaded dog photos stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
2. **Photo Rotation**: An AWS Lambda function automatically shifts the photos daily, renaming them to follow a specific order.
3. **Static Website**: A static HTML page fetches the latest dog photo from S3 and displays it.
4. **Automation**: The system ensures a fresh photo appears every 24 hours.
